# Budweiser EDA
-   In this EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) we will conduct an analysis about the beers sold by Budweiser across different states in the United States. In addition, we will show deep analysis across different beer names, styles, and companies to shed more light into some of the weakness and advantages of certian business strategies.

-   The whole idea of this analysis is to focus on the different business areas that the Budweiser corporation could improve so that these insights could turn into business solutions.
